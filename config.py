    'what is cryptocurrency? ü§î' :'What Is Cryptocurrency?\ncryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology‚Äîa distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.',
    'how does cryptocurrency work? ü§Ø' :'How does cryptocurrency work?\nCryptocurrencies run on a distributed public ledger called blockchain, a record of all transactions updated and held by currency holders.Units of cryptocurrency are created through a process called mining, which involves using computer power to solve complicated mathematical problems that generate coins. Users can also buy the currencies from brokers, then store and spend them using cryptographic wallets.If you own cryptocurrency, you don‚Äôt own anything tangible. What you own is a key that allows you to move a record or a unit of measure from one person to another without a trusted third party.Although Bitcoin has been around since 2009, cryptocurrencies and applications of blockchain technology are still emerging in financial terms, and more uses are expected in the future. Transactions including bonds, stocks, and other financial assets could eventually be traded using the technology.',
